/**
 * Imagine we have an image. We'll represent this image as a simple 2D array where every pixel is a 1 or a 0.
 * There is 1 rectangle made up of 0s in the image. Find the coordinates of the rectangle.
 * Either return the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners, 
 * or if you would prefer, the top-left coordinates, width and height of the rectangle.
